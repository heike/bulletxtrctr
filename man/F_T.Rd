\title{Reference density for the test statistic between Same-source and Different-source averages using phase selection}
\usage{
f_T(t, sigma = 1, n = 6)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{value of the observed test statistic, t is non-negative}

\item{sigma}{(estimated) standard deviation of an average of size n of the (original) sample}

\item{n}{integer value, number of values in the same-source group.}
}
\description{
Assuming an overall sample size of 36 (for 6 x 6 comparisons, n=6 independent objects), we are interested in the distribution of
T defined as the difference between the average of the same source values and the median average (XXX see paper for definition) of the different source values:
\deqn{T = \bar{X}_{SS} - \tilde{X}_{DS}}, where groups SS and DS are set by phase selection (after inspecting the set of $n$ values).
For a (one-sided) hypothesis test of \eqn{H_0}: no difference between the means and \eqn{H_1:}: the same-source values are larger
on average than the different source values, the test statistic T has under the null hypothesis and the group-finding
strategy \eqn{\cal G} a distribution given as
\deqn{P(T < t \mid H_0, {\cal G}) = C \cdot \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F^2(x) f(x) \left[ F(x + t) - F(x) \right]^3 dx}
where $F$ is the (approximately normal) distribution of \eqn{\bar{X}_{SS}} under \eqn{H_0} with expected value of Âµ (\eqn{=E[\bar{X}_{SS}] = E[\bar{X}_{DS}]}) and standard deviation
\eqn{\sigma} (standard deviation of a group of size n under the null hypothesis).
